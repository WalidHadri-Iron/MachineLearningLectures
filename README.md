# Machine Learning Lectures
I am still a student, learning Machine Learning by myself, to share my passion about its related topics, I have decided to learn while I am elaborating some lectures that could help others. The best way for me to test our knowledge is being able to explain it to others. I really recommand you to use Google to answer every question that comes to your mind, focus on the mathematical background before jumping to coding.
