# Machine Learning Lectures
I am still student learning Machine Learning, to share my passion about its topics, I have decided to learn while I am constructing some lectures that could help others afterwards. The best way for me to test you knowledge is being able to explain it to others. I really recommand you to use Google to answer every question that comes to your mind, focus the mathematical background before jumping to code.

*Lecture 0*: [Machine Learning, Data Science and Artificial intelligence]()
*Lecture 1*: Introduction to Machine Learning()
